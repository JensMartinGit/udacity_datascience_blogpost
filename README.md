# Analyzing special Features of Data Scientists, compared to other Developer Types, based on Stack Overflow Survey Data from 2017 to 2020

## 1. Installation

The notebook uses Python 3.7.9 (Anaconda 4.9.2 distribution) and the libraries pandas and numpy for data analysis as well as matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

## 2. Project Motivation

The goal of this notebook is to analyse Stack Overflow Survey Data for writing a blog post on the differences between data scientists and "traditional" software developers with regards to aspects like education level, gender, income, and job satisfaction.

In addition to analyzing the most recent survey data from 2020 I will also integrate some data from the previous years to discern certain trends over the years.

The notebook and associated blog post is a project work for my Data Scientist Nanodegree on Udacity.

## 3. File Descriptions

The whole data analysis is in the Jupyter notebook Stack Overflow Data Scientist.ipynb.


## 4. Major Results

The main results from the analysis summarized in a blogpost on Medium titled: **Is Data Science really that sexy (as everyone says)? - 7 data driven facts about the probably most hyped job of the 21st century.**

Boiled down to 7 catchy facts that fit a blog post, the conclusion is that:

1. With a proportion of data scientists oscillating steady around 7 percent, there is no glut of data scientists. At least not within the Stack Overflow community.
2. Quite similar to computer science in general, there is a significant male surplus in the field of data science, with a slightly higher proportion of non-males (10.7% in 2020) and at least a slight but steady trend towards more gender diversity (that cannot be found within the rest of the Stack Overflow community).
3. On average, data scientists have a significantly higher education level than other developer types, with a striking proportion of 13.5% of all data scientists holding a doctoral degree.
4. Compared to other developers, a significantly higher proportion of data scientist has a non CS related undergraduate major, with both mathematics and statistics and natural or health sciences beeing common study fields for data scientists.
5. These differences in primary study fields are more distinct for female data scientists.
6. The median income of data scientists is about 4,000 USD higher than for other developer types.
7. On average, data scientists are more satisfied with their job than other developers.
